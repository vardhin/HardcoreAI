"""The Toolbox: the concrete tools the agent calls in each phase.

A Toolbox is constructed per agent run with the project, its DB session, the
component catalogue, and a working copy of the workbench. Tools mutate that
working copy (and, in phase 2, code-file content) in memory; the caller commits
once the phase finishes.

Two tool sets:
  WiringToolbox — place/move/rotate/remove components, wire/unwire pins.
  CodingToolbox — inspect the finished netlist, read/write code files.

Both share read-only inspection tools so the model can always re-orient itself.
